# Form Validations with React Hook Form and Zod

This documentation will guide you on how to implement form validations using React Hook Form library integrated with Zod schema validation.

## What is React Hook Form?

React Hook Form is a library optimized for managing forms in React with a focus on performance and developer experience by leveraging React hooks.

### Advantages

- **Performance**: Enhances performance by only tracking input changes.
- **Easy Integration**: Easily integrates into React projects due to its hook-based architecture.
- **Support for Yup, Zod**: Supports integration with schema validation libraries like Yup, Zod for validation rules.

## What is Zod?
Zod is a TypeScript-compatible schema validation library used to define and validate object and data structures, enhancing type safety and developer productivity.

### Installation

To install React Hook Form & Zod, follow these steps:

1. Install React Hook Form in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install react-hook-form
1. Install Zod in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install zod

## You can examine the source codes of an example of a registration page using schema (Patterns, validations) that I made with React hook from and Zod.
